### Summary

I learned a ton of stuff in this class about Python and creating a website from the frontend to the backend. The class was a lot of work since it was during the summer, but I definitely think it was worth it. I am about to take the final test today and I am pretty worried as the last couple weeks have flown by as far as content. We have learned entire subjects in one class period and now we are going to be tested over them. I do not feel prepared to take a test that involves SQL, XML and JSON Schemas (even though I have worked a ton with JSON in my work history), and RegEx. I feel like I have learned a lot of valuable skills in this class and I have even started a personal project where I am writing a RESTful API that I can implement in an iOS app that I am currently working on. I got the server up and running this past weekend and then ran into some troubles making calls to other RESTful APIs because the SSL handshake was failing. This is my second class that I have taken with Downing and he never seems to disappoint. Downing knows a lot about a lot of things. He taught me a ton about C++ and now he has tought me a ton about Python as well, and with the project I also feel comfortable with Flask and the other tools we used to get the web app done. Building a web app for a class is a lot more useful than the kinds of programs you build in other classes which is why I enjoyed this class so much. Just hoping I can do well on the final now...
