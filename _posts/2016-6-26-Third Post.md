Third Blog Post!

### What did you do this past week?

This past week I finished up the Netflix project. It wasn't super hard, just took some time to get everything working properly. I think that we ended up doing well. We ended with a .96 RMSE which I was extremely happy with, and it ran very quickly as well. I also tried to soak up all the Python concepts that got dropped on us very quickly. The * and ** and default values in method names can get stick very fast and so I need to wrap my head around that better before the test tomorrow.

### What's in your way?

I just read the description for assignment 3 and it looks extremely time consuming for only having a week to work on it. I am worried about having to work in a group since I currently work full time. I don't have a lot of free time and I like to do work on my own time so I am worried about being in a group where people are relying on me since work is my number one priority.

### What will you do next week?

This next week I will do some last minute studying for the test and then getting started on assignment 3. I need to find a group and get started early so that I don't have to worry too much about getting everything done on time.

### Overall class comments

This fast is starting to progress very quickly. This third project seems like a huge jump up from the last one. Interested to see how this test goes as a lot of information got dropped on us very quickly this past week so the test could be very difficult. Still not a fan of Canvas discussions.

### Tip of the week

Take breaks. Don't try and be a hero and code for 8 hours at a time. Get up and walk around. Staring at a screen for long periods at a time will make you tired and you will also start to make more mistakes. Get up an walk around for a bit every hour or two.
