Fourth Blog Post!

### What did you do this past week?

This past week we took the first test. I thought the test was very fair. We had ample time and all of the questions were definitely within reach. I spent a majority of my time trying to figure out one of the questions, and the rest came to me very quickly. The one question I struggled with I eventually came up with some solution I thought was definitely wrong, but when I got home I looked it up and I actually think that I got it right. The rest of the week my group and I got a headstart early and started knocking out the project. It has kind of been slow progress, but we are getting close to having it done. It is hard to coordinate 6 different people with 6 different schedules.

### What's in your way?

Schedules. Everyone on our group has different schedules, and my schedule is probably the worst. I work until about 6 pm or so every day, and I am not able to mentally go from programming all day at work to going home and going straight to doing my programming homework. So normally I can't start my school work until late at night. A big portion of our group was also out for the Fourth of July, but luckily we got an early start so we aren't super worried.

### What will you do next week?

Next week is going to be a busy week. Lots of personal plans, work plans, and then inevitably project plans. Next week will be finishing up phase 1 of the project and starting on phase 2.

### Overall class comments

Very happy with how the first test went. Now, I thought that for all of the tests in OOP, but I never seemed to receive the grade that I thought I deserved on the test. Hopefully this semester is different. So far the projects seem like a ton of work for only having one week, but that's part of taking a summer class I suppose. Reiterating once again that I am not really a fan of Canvas discussion, I discuss this in blog post number two and three.

### Tip of the week

The internet is full of smart people. If you get absolutely stuck on a problem while working on this project then just Google around and I am sure someone else has had this same exact problem/question. There is no shame in doing this, everyone in the real world does this. Just make sure that when you find an answer that you fully understand it and don't just copy and paste.
