### What did you do this past week?

I did not do much last week for this class other than keeping up with the inclass materials. I haven't started the project yet as I took OOP last semester so I already have the code in C++ I just need to convert it over to Python and make sure I have all the new tools set up.

### What's in your way?

Time is always my issue. I work a full time job and so motivating myself to do school work when I get home for a long day at work can be tough. Getting over the initial hurdle is my biggest problem. Once I get going on the project I will knock it out. Just gotta convince myself to start it.

### What will you do next week?

I will be finish up Collatz this next week and do the readings. I will also try and get ahead on the next project so that I don't keep up this whole procrastination thing that I have going on right now.

### Overall class comments

I love this class. I took OOP last semester and I learned so much in that class, and knowing that the professor is a guru in the subject makes even a 1 hour and 45 minute long class bearable. I feel like I leave class with a brain full of new knowledge about Python and how I can use this language further down in my career.

### Tip of the week

This class is going to be a wild ride, and it is going to get intense fast so make sure you keep up with the projects and readings and don't let them go until the last minute. I learned that last semester taking OOP with Downing. There were a couple all nighters due to me thinking a project was going to be a lot easier than it was. Also lack of sleep compounds your bugs and thus makes it end up taking longer anyway. So get started early and take breaks often.
