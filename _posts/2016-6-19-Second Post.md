Second Blog Post!

### What did you do this past week?

This past week I finished up the Collatz project. I had already done this project in OOP so it was a pretty easy project for me. The main lift was to convert the C++ to Python, which was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The main challenege was to pass Sphere with the timing constraints. Last semester we didn't have to pass Sphere because of the broken input so this year I had to add some more optimizations to get it to pass. I also started working on the Netflix project that is due this upcoming Tuesday.

### What's in your way?

Once again my free time to work on the projects is in my way. Working 40 hour weeks and going to school makes it difficult to want to program after already having programmed all day. Trying to mitigate my procrastination is what is going to get me through this class.

### What will you do next week?

This next week I will be finishing up the Netflix project with my partner Jason Dimitriou and then I will get started studying for the test next Monday. Friday's class got pretty crazy with different cases doing completely different things so it is going to be a challenge remmembering every single use case and which does what.

### Overall class comments

Python is pretty sweet. Lots of cool things you can do, just gotta remember all the small intricacies as doing something doesn't always produce the results you think it may, which makes it easy for you to shoot yourself in the foot. I also have decided that I am not a huge fan of using Canvas discussions. I prefer Piazza way more than Canvas for discussion. On Piazza you can quickly go through and read discussions, on Canvas you are brought to another page and have to hit back and then you are no longer as the same scroll offset in the list so you have to figure out where you were to continue going through the list. Also if you have class internet connection having to reload pages time and time again on Canvas is a huge pain. 

### Tip of the week

I do a lot of the interviewing at the company I work for and one of the biggest tips I have is this. If you want to get into a new development, ie mobile development, and you want to follow a tutorial to learn, make sure that you don't copy and paste code from the tutorial. You really need to understand what you are doing so that if you are asked about it in an interview you can talk about it. It is very obvious when someone has just copy and pasted their way to the completion of the project.
