Fifth Blog Post!

### What did you do this past week?

This past week I have been working on the project. We finished up phase two Monday night and did some cleanup Tuesday before turning it in. Among other things I wrote the RESTful API using Python and Flask. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be. The main pain point of the last project was scraping the data from the various RESTful APIs and websites we used to scrape the data and load that into our database. That took us probably 85% of the time, but we learned a lot in the process and I am pretty happy with the result.

### What's in your way?

In my last post I mentioned schedules being in our way, but we have been really good about communication and have been finding time for the majority of us to meet up. Our main problem right now is we are supposed to integrate another group's RESTful API that they were supposed to finish last phase and it is the day before this next phase is due and their API is currently throwing internal server errors. So that's super annoying because now we are going to have to integrate their RESTful API at the last minute assuming they eventually get it to work.

### What will you do next week?

Next week is the final exam. I will be studying up until then. Not exactly sure what will be on the test since it seems like we haven't covered much material since the last test, but I will study what we have learned and hope for the best.

### Overall class comments

I mentioned being very happy about how the last test went last blog, but the grade definitely did not agree. I took OOP last semester and the same thing happened on both tests. I feel like the rubric is graded towards a specific answer even when there could be tons of different ways to solve the problem...but it is what it is I guess. Also, I mentioned not being a fan of Canvas Discussions, but using Canvas Discussions in place of Google Docs is even worse because now all of the notes from class are scattered throughout the onslaught of all discussions instead of being in one convenient location...sigh.

### Tip of the week

Don't try and integrate the other group's RESTful API in Javascript. We tried doing that and ran into a bunch of problems. Instead integrate the RESTful API in Python and render the template for the page with the data and use Jinja to access it from the HTML. Once we did it this way it was easy peezy getting D3.js to work (other than their lack of documentation noting if all the bubbles don't fit it will hang up the browser).
